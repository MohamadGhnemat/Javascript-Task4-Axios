        <h1>Difference between axios and fetch :-</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>API Design: axios is built on top of the XMLHttpRequest object, while fetch is a web API built into modern browsers. This means that axios has a more intuitive and feature-rich API, while fetch has a simpler and more modern API.</li>
        <li>Browser Compatibility: axios is compatible with a wide range of browsers, including older versions, making it a good choice for projects with browser compatibility concerns. On the other hand, fetch is only supported in modern browsers, so it might not work in older browsers without polyfills.</li>
        <li>Error Handling: axios has built-in support for error handling and provides more detailed error messages. fetch, on the other hand, only throws an error for network issues and does not provide specific error messages for various HTTP status codes.</li>
        <li>Interceptors: axios allows you to intercept and modify requests or responses before they are sent or processed, which can be useful for tasks like authentication and request/response logging. fetch does not have built-in support for interceptors.</li>
        </ul>
